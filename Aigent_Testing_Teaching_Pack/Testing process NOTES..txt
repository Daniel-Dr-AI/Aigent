Module 01, testing. 


Slack webhook process is deprecated, update to connect via "Slack apps" - Webhook url: [REDACTED - Configure in .env as NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL]

Notes on possible error, changes and updates needed.  

-line 43, cant run Module and get "green toggle", there are current 'errors' are these structural or do we simply need data?
-If you don't have a CRM you need to disable the node "right click, select disable".
-Need instructions for collecting all of the variables for each workflow setup.
-Env instructions, you cannot edit the .env in the cloud hosted N8N, only when self hosting can you upload the whole .env file.  For the browser version you have to input the variables one at a time. 
-Follow steps on Envinstructions starting line #132 prior to beginning testing of module 01.
-#223 N8N credential for google sheets, directions not clear.
-***When using the cloud instance of N8N the Expression is {{Vars.GOOGLE... NOT {{.Env , if self hosting then the variables will come from the {{ENV, !!  There are multiple pre-filled nodes with the {{Env used...
- Note google sheets setup, set name in bottom left of google sheets page, ID is in URL as described.
- Setup for 'Append to Data store node', select 'Document "by ID" for sheets ID value from URL, then "by name" for the Tab name.
-Map coulmns manually (drag expressions from 'Input' into list), the 'automatic' setting sends everything and requires that the receiving app filters and organizes the data appropriately, which is not the case in this example.
