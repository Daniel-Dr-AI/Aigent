# Aigent Testing & Learning Package

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31
**Maintained by:** Aigent QA Architecture Team

---

## Welcome!

This package will teach you how to **test and understand** all 10 modules of the Aigent Universal Clinic Template system.

**Don't worry if you've never done software testing before** — everything here is written for complete beginners. We'll explain every step, every term, and every button you need to click.

---

## What Is This Package For?

This Testing & Learning Package helps you:

1. **Test each module thoroughly** — make sure everything works correctly before using it with real patients
2. **Learn how the system works** — understand what each part does and why it matters
3. **Catch problems early** — find and fix issues in a safe testing environment
4. **Build confidence** — gain hands-on experience so you can train others

---

## Who Should Use This?

- **New team members** learning the Aigent system
- **Clinic administrators** who want to verify everything works correctly
- **Technical staff** responsible for maintaining workflows
- **Anyone** who wants to understand healthcare automation

**No coding experience required!** We explain everything in plain English.

## What's Inside?

### `/00_Shared/` — Universal Materials
Files and resources used across all modules:
- **Course_Syllabus.md** — Your learning roadmap (start here!)
- **EnvMatrix.md** — Explains all the connection settings in plain language
- **MockIdentities.json** — Fake patient data for safe testing (never use real people!)
- **BugReport_Template.md** — How to document problems you find
- **TestData_Generators.js** — Tool for creating random test data
- And more helpful resources...

### Module Folders (01 through 10)
Each module has its own complete testing package:
- **TestPlan.md** — Step-by-step instructions for all tests
- **TestCases.md** — List of specific tests with expected results
- **MockData/** — Sample data files for testing
- **Observability.md** — Where to look to confirm success
- **Troubleshooting.md** — Common problems and how to fix them
- **TeachingNotes.md** — How to explain this to others
- **KeyPoints.md** — Important takeaways and reminders

### `/CrossModule_Tests/` — Integration Testing
Tests that verify multiple modules work together correctly:
- **Chain_Tests.md** — Complete patient journey from lead to follow-up
- **Manager_Integration_Tests.md** — System orchestration and health checks

## The 10 Modules

1. **Intake & Lead Capture** — How new patients enter your system
2. **Consult Booking & Scheduling** — Appointment scheduling with calendar integration

## How to Use This Package

### Step 1: Start with the Syllabus
Open `/00_Shared/Course_Syllabus.md` to see the recommended learning path.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Read `/00_Shared/EnvMatrix.md` to understand your system settings.
You'll need these "environment variables" (connection keys) for testing.

### Step 3: Review Mock Data
Look at `/00_Shared/MockIdentities.json` to see the fake patients and staff we'll use.
**Never test with real patient data** — it's unsafe and may be illegal!

### Step 4: Test Each Module
Follow the `TestPlan.md` in each module folder, starting with Module 01.
Each test plan tells you:
- What to do (step by step)
- What you should see (expected results)
- Why it matters (real-world reasoning)
- What can go wrong (common mistakes)

### Step 5: Practice Integration Testing
Once you've tested all individual modules, try the `/CrossModule_Tests/` to see how they work together.

### Step 6: Document What You Find
Use the `BugReport_Template.md` if you discover any problems.
This helps track issues and communicate them clearly.

## Key Principles

### 1. Safety First
- **Never use real patient data** in testing
- **Always test in a separate environment** (not your live clinic system)
- **Check compliance logs** to ensure privacy protection is working

### 2. Learn by Doing
- **Try every test yourself** — don't just read about it
- **Make mistakes on purpose** — enter bad data to see what happens
- **Ask "why?"** — understand the reason behind each test

### 3. Document Everything
- **Write down what you see** — especially unexpected results
- **Take screenshots** when something looks wrong
- **Keep notes** about what you learned

### 4. Start Simple, Build Up
- **Test one thing at a time** first
- **Combine tests** once you're comfortable
- **Eventually test the full patient journey** across all modules

## Testing Themes

Every module includes tests for these important scenarios:

1. **Happy Path** — Everything works perfectly (this should pass!)
2. **Invalid Inputs** — Bad or missing data (system should handle gracefully)
3. **System Failures** — What if an email service is down?
4. **Repeated Actions** — Can you run the same test twice without problems?
5. **Timeouts** — What if something takes too long?
6. **Security Checks** — Is private information protected?
7. **Compliance Logging** — Are actions being recorded properly?
8. **Integration** — Does data pass correctly to the next step?
9. **Recovery** — Can the system retry after an error?
10. **Observation** — Can you see what happened and why?

## Glossary (Words You'll See Often)

**API** — Application Programming Interface. A way for two computer programs to talk to each other securely. Like a waiter taking your order to the kitchen.

**API Key** — A password that allows one program to connect to another. Like showing your ID card to enter a building.

**Environment Variable** — A setting that tells the workflow where to connect or what password to use. Stored safely outside the workflow itself.

**Mock Data** — Fake information used for testing. Like practice patients who don't exist in real life.

**Happy Path** — A test where everything goes right. Used to confirm basic functionality works.

**Edge Case** — An unusual or extreme situation. Like testing what happens if someone's name is 200 characters long.

**PHI** — Protected Health Information. Private patient data that must be kept secure by law.

**HIPAA** — A U.S. law requiring healthcare organizations to protect patient privacy.

**Workflow** — A series of automated steps. Like a recipe that the computer follows.

**n8n** — The automation tool that runs Aigent workflows. Pronounced "n-eight-n".

**Node** — A single step in a workflow. Like one instruction in a recipe.

**Execution** — One complete run through a workflow from start to finish.

**Webhook** — A way for one system to notify another when something happens. Like a doorbell that alerts you when someone arrives.

**Idempotency** — The ability to run the same action multiple times safely. Like a light switch — flipping it "on" multiple times still leaves it on.

## Getting Help

### If You're Stuck
1. Check the **Troubleshooting.md** file in the module you're testing
2. Review the **KeyPoints.md** to make sure you understood the basics
3. Look at the **TeachingNotes.md** for additional context
4. Try the test again with fresh mock data

### If You Find a Bug
1. Open **00_Shared/BugReport_Template.md**
2. Fill out the template with what you saw
3. Include screenshots if possible
4. Note which mock data you used

### If You Need Clarification
- All technical terms are defined in this README's Glossary section
- Each module's TestPlan explains concepts as they appear
- The Course_Syllabus includes learning objectives for each section

## Important Reminders

⚠️ **Never use real patient data in testing** — Use only the mock data provided
⚠️ **Test in a separate environment** — Not your live production system
⚠️ **Check compliance logs** — Verify Module 09 is recording your test actions
⚠️ **Document unexpected results** — Even small oddities might indicate problems
⚠️ **Ask questions** — Better to clarify than to make incorrect assumptions
